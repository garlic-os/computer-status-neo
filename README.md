_Qt rewrite of Computer Status Tool Â© 2015 Chris Bucher_

WMIC is deprecated as of Windows 10 21H1. With its removal coming at an unknown but inevitable date, we've decided we need to move Computer Status Tool away from WMIC. And also that it would likely be better to re-write it from the ground up in the process.

**This project is a work in progress with no guarantee of stability. There are bugs and missing features.**

## Improvements
- App doesn't freeze while running a command
- Will continue to work without WMIC
- Dark mode

## New actions
- Reverse Shell
- Reactivate Windows license
- Reinstall Office 365
- Get Azure AD Join status
- Enumerate installed printers
- Install a printer by name
- SFC & DISM

## Missing features
- Lab tab
- Reports tab
- Run as different user
- Documentation
- Trigger SCCM
- Get serial number

## Roadmap
